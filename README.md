# Dotfiles

This contains my dotfiles and some system setup utilities for MacOS.

## Install

To install the dotfiles, run the below command:

```bash
 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maximus1108/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```

This will install git on the system via Homebrew if it doesn't already exist.
